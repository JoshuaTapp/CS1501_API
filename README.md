# CS1501_API
## API project for CS1501 unit 2.2

This was a little 1 hour project to familiarize myself with API's. I created developer accounts with Twilio and Giphy to gain API keys. Then I used python to create
a program that can send random downsampled gifs of SMS to any number. 

The project opened my eyes to how powerful API's are. It was so easy to set up everything. The Docs for each respective company were excellent.

Here is a gif of the gifs coming in to my phone.
